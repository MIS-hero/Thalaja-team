- This report has is Stage two of the final project devoloment; it covers Objectives, scope, Stakeholders, Roles, Risks and the High-level plan.
---
## Project Objectives

- A cross-platform mobile application that allows household groups to sync grocery lists in real time, achieving a minimum of 500 active users and 4.5 star rating on the App Store in the first six months of release
- Within the first 3-months of beta launch, achieve a “Shared -to-Single User ratio” of 2:1, where at least 65% of all registered users have successfully joined otrcreated a group with at least one other member.

## Stakeholders and Roles

### Stakeholders:

**Internals:** Team members, Mentors

**External:** End users, Retailers and Supermarket, cloud service providers

### Roles:

- Work simultaneously on Full Stack development of the App.

## Scope

**In Scope:**

- Real-time Shared List Creation: Multiple members can add, edit, and delete items from a unified household list simultaneously.
- Granular Product Specifications: Fields for specifying Brand, Size/Weight (e.g., 500g, 1L), and Quantity to eliminate shopping errors.
- Smart Category Arrangement: Automatic sorting of items by aisle or category (e.g., Produce, Dairy, Frozen) to optimize the walking path through the store.
- Member Assignments: The ability to "claim" specific items on the list so other members know who is responsible for picking them up.
- Visual Status Indicators: Clear "In-Cart" vs. "Pending" states to prevent double-buying while members are in different aisles.
- Image References: Option to attach a photo of a specific product/brand to ensure the exact item is purchased.

**Out of Scope:**

- All Financial Transactions: No payment processing, bill splitting, or price tracking.
- Budgeting Tools: No tracking of total spending or monthly grocery costs.
- Store Inventory APIs: No real-time checking of whether an item is currently in stock at a specific local supermarket

## Risks

**Step 1: Identify Threats**

- Technical / Sync Risks: Data Desynchronization: Two Family members are at the store simultaneously. One checks off "1L Almarai Milk," but the update fails to sync to the other user's app due to poor cellular connectivity in the store, causing them to buy a second bottle (Double Buying).

- System Downtime: database goes down on a Saturday morning during peak weekend grocery shopping hours.

**User Adoption & UX Risks:**
- Form Fatigue: Because of requiring brand, size, and quantity, users might find it too hard to add simple items (e.g., typing out "Almarai, 1L, Full Fat" just for milk) and abandon the app for a basic notes app.

- Category Misalignment: auto-sorting places an item under "Bakery," but in the user's local store, that specific item is kept in the "Snacks" aisle, causing confusion.

**Step 2: Estimate Risk (The Impact/Likelihood Matrix)**

| Threat | Likelihood (1–5) | Impact (1–5) | Risk Exposure Score | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| In-store Sync Delay (Data collision) | 4 | 4 | 16 | High |
| User Abandonment (Form fatigue) | 3 | 4 | 12 | Medium |
| Wrong Category Sort (UX layout) | 4 | 2 | 8 | Low |
| Server Provider Outage | 1 | 5 | 5 | Low |

**Step 3: Manage and Mitigate Risks**

**Mitigation for Sync Failures (High Priority):**
- Strategy (Reduction): Implement Optimistic UI Updates. When a user checks an item, the app immediately shows it as "checked" locally and queues the network request. If the sync fails after a timeout, the app alerts the user: "Sync failed. Please check connection." rather than silently staying un-synced.

**Mitigation for Form Fatigue (Medium Priority):**
- Strategy (Avoidance): Build an Auto-complete / History cache. The first time they type "Milk," they fill out the brand and size. The next time they type "Milk," the app autofills their previously preferred brand and size in one click.

**Mitigation for Category Misalignment (Low Priority):**
- Strategy (Contingency): Allow users to manually drag and drop items to re-categorize them on the fly if the algorithm gets it wrong.

**Step 4: Monitor and Review**
- Review Metric: Track the percentage of offline sync conflicts resolved successfully in your backend logs.

- Feedback Loops: Check user analytics. If the drop-off rate on the "Add Item" screen is high, it means form fatigue is winning, and you need to simplify the data entry UI.
