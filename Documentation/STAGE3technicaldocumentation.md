## 1.1 Actors

| Actor | Description |
|---|---|
| **Guest** | Unauthenticated user who has installed the app |
| **Member** | Authenticated user belonging to one or more groups |
| **Admin** | Member with the admin role in a specific group — can manage group membership, names, icons, and remove lists and recipes. Admin role is singular per group; transferring it removes the current admin's privileges. |
| **Buyer** | Member who has been assigned or has volunteered for the current shopping trip — not a permanent role |
| **Recipe Owner** | The member who created a specific recipe. This is a per-recipe designation, not a group-level role. |

---

## 1.2 User Stories

### 1. Authentication & Onboarding

| ID | Story | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| US-01 | As a guest, I want to create an account with my name, phone, and email, so that I can join or create a household group. | **Must Have** |
| US-02 | As a guest, I want to log in with my email or phone, so that I can access my groups and lists. | **Must Have** |
| US-36 | As a guest, I want to verify my phone number via OTP during registration — delivered by SMS, WhatsApp, or email — so that my account is tied to a real identity. If one channel fails, the app automatically falls back to an available alternative. | **Must Have** |
| US-03 | As a member, I want to update my display name and avatar, so that my identity is recognizable to other group members. | Should Have |

---

### 2. Group Management

| ID | Story | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| US-04 | As a member, I want to create a group and receive a shareable invite code, so that I can bring my household or friends into one shared space. | **Must Have** |
| US-05 | As a member, I want to join a group using an invite code, so that I can access its shared lists. | **Must Have** |
| US-06 | As a member, I want to belong to multiple groups at the same time, so that I can coordinate groceries across different households. | **Must Have** |
| US-07 | As a member, I want to share the group invite code with others, so that I can bring new people in without requiring admin action. | **Must Have** |
| US-08 | As an admin, I want to remove a member from the group, so that I control who has access to our lists. | Should Have |
| US-09 | As an admin, I want to edit the group name and icon, so that the group is clearly identifiable across multiple groups. | Should Have |
| US-10 | As an admin, I want to transfer my admin role to another member — losing my own admin status in the process — so that group ownership can be handed over cleanly. | Should Have |
| US-11 | As an admin, I want to remove a list from the group, so that the group's list view stays relevant and organized. | Should Have |
| US-12 | As an admin, I want to remove a recipe from the group, so that outdated or unused recipes don't clutter the recipe library. | Should Have |

---

### 3. List Management

| ID | Story | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| US-13 | As a member, I want to create and name a shared grocery list within a group, so that everyone can add their items before the shopping trip. | **Must Have** |
| US-15 | As a buyer, I want to close the active list when the shopping trip is done, so that it moves to the group's trip history and the active view stays clean. | **Must Have** |
| US-14 | As an admin, I want to edit the list name and icon after creation, so that lists can be renamed or visually distinguished without recreating them. | Should Have |

---

### 4. Item Submission

| ID | Story | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| US-16 | As a member, I want to add an item manually with name, brand, quantity, unit, and notes, so that the buyer has the detail they need to find exactly what I want. | **Must Have** |
| US-17 | As a member, I want to browse my item history and re-add a past item, so that I don't have to re-enter its details from scratch. | **Must Have** |
| US-21 | As a member, I want to attach an image to an item I'm adding, so that the buyer can visually confirm the exact product on the shelf. | Should Have |
| US-22 | As a member, I want to mark an item as urgent when adding it, so that the buyer knows it cannot wait for the next full trip. | Should Have |
| US-23 | As a member, I want to bulk-delete all items from the list after a confirmation step, so that I can reset the list when needed — with the option to undo the action via the list's action log. | Should Have |
| US-18 | As a member, I want to browse a grocery catalog and select items from it, so that I can add common products without typing. | Should Have |
| US-19 | As a member, I want to scan an item's barcode, so that its name and details are filled in automatically. | Could Have |
| US-20 | As a member, I want to take a photo of an item and have it identified automatically, so that I can add it quickly without knowing the exact product name. | Could Have |

---

### 5. Real-Time Collaboration

| ID | Story | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| US-24 | As a member viewing a list, I want to see other members' additions, edits, and removals appear in real time without refreshing, so that the list stays synchronized during active collaboration. | **Must Have** |

---

### 6. Duplicate Prevention

| ID | Story | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| US-25 | As a member, I want to see a non-blocking warning when the item I'm adding may already be on the list, so that I can decide whether to add it anyway or update the existing entry instead. | **Must Have** |

---

### 7. Buying Trip View

| ID | Story | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| US-26 | As a buyer, I want a dedicated buying view that locks the list from edits, organizes items by grocery aisle category in a standard store aisle sequence, and lets me check off items as I shop, so that I can move through the store efficiently without accidental changes. | **Must Have** |
| US-38 | As a buyer, I want to lock the active list into a trip so no one can edit it while I shop, check off items as I pick them up, and finish the trip so that any items I did not buy are automatically returned to the active list for the next shopping run. | **Must Have** |
| US-27 | As a buyer, I want to filter the buying view to show only urgent items, so that I can complete a quick trip when I don't have time for a full shop. | Should Have |

---

### 8. History

| ID | Story | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| US-28 | As a member, I want to browse the action log for a list — showing who added, edited, removed, or bulk-deleted items and when — so that I stay informed of all updates made by other members. | **Must Have** |
| US-29 | As a member, I want to see a trip history showing past completed shopping trips, so that I can reference what was bought in previous trips. | Should Have |

---

### 9. Notifications

| ID | Story | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| US-30 | As a buyer, I want to tap a "heading to store" button that sends a push notification to all group members, so that they have a final window to add any last-minute items before I leave. | **Must Have** |
| US-31 | As a member, I want to assign a buyer for the upcoming trip and send them a push notification, so that the designated person knows they are expected to shop. | Should Have |
| US-32 | As a member, I want to send a reminder notification to a specific group member to add their items to the list, so that no one's needs are missed before the trip. | Could Have |

---

### 10. Recipes

| ID | Story | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| US-37 | As a recipe owner, I want to be able to edit or delete a recipe I created, so that I have control over my own content in the group. | **Must Have** |
| US-33 | As a member, I want to create and save a recipe with a name, image, step-by-step instructions, and an ingredients list (name, quantity, and unit per ingredient), so that I can reuse it across multiple shopping trips. | Should Have |
| US-34 | As a member, I want to import all ingredients from a saved recipe to any list I have access to in one tap, so that I don't have to add each ingredient individually. | Should Have |
| US-35 | As a group, I want to share saved recipes within our group, so that any member can view and import a group recipe to the list. | Could Have |

### 4.3 Account Recovery

With Authentica OTP authentication, account recovery is structurally identical to Sign In — the user re-verifies ownership of their registered phone number to receive a new JWT. Lost-phone recovery is out of scope for this phase and is handled by Authentica support procedures.

## 8. SCM Plan

### Branching Strategy

| Branch | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `main` | Production-ready code only. Protected — no direct pushes. |
| `dev` | Integration branch. All feature branches merge here first. |
| `feature/<name>` | One branch per Jira card (e.g. `feature/auth-otp-flow`) |
| `fix/<name>` | Bug fixes discovered during QA or beta |
| `docs/<name>` | Documentation-only changes |

### Workflow

1. Branch off `dev` for every Jira card
2. Open a Pull Request targeting `dev` when the card is done
3. At least 1 teammate approval required before merge
4. `dev` → `main` PR opened at the end of each sprint after integration QA passes

### Commit Convention

```
type: short description

Types: feat · fix · docs · refactor · test · chore
Example: feat: add OTP verification endpoint
```

### Rules

- Never commit directly to `main` or `dev`
- No `--no-verify` to bypass hooks
- API contract changes require both leads to approve the PR

---

## 9. QA Plan

### Testing Layers

| Layer | Tool | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit tests — Flutter | flutter_test | BLoC logic, use cases, data models |
| Unit tests — Backend | pytest | Service methods, repository queries |
| API integration tests | Postman collections | All external API endpoints |
| Manual smoke tests | Device (iOS + Android) | Full user flows each sprint |
| Beta testing | 5 household groups | Real-world usage with survey feedback |

### Definition of Done

A feature card is done when:
1. Unit tests pass for the affected service or BLoC
2. Postman collection test for the endpoint passes
3. Manual smoke test on a real device confirms the golden path
4. No open critical bugs linked to the card

### Bug Tracking

All bugs are filed as Jira issues tagged `bug` with severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low).
Critical and High bugs block the sprint from closing.

## 10. Technical Justifications

| Technology | Why Chosen |
| --- | --- |
| Flutter | The team built Thalaja v1 in Swift; Flutter lets us ship iOS and Android from one codebase for v2 without splitting the team |
| Flask | The team has prior experience with Flask, and it integrates directly with Flask-SocketIO — no separate real-time server needed |
| PostgreSQL via Supabase | Managed hosting removes infra overhead; relational model fits our entity structure with clear FKs and constraints |
| Flask-SocketIO | Architecture constraint: real-time events must flow through Flask only, not directly from a Supabase Realtime subscription on the client |
| Firebase FCM | Handles push delivery to both iOS and Android without running our own notification infrastructure |
| Authentica | Provides OTP over SMS, WhatsApp, and email with automatic fallback — gives users recovery options when one channel fails, with better UX than single-channel providers |
| BLoC | Keeps Flutter UI state predictable and testable when async WebSocket events arrive and modify list state |
| Dio | Chosen over Flutter's default http package for its interceptor support (JWT injection) and multipart upload needed for item images |
| Altamimi catalog | Saudi-localized grocery item data with barcodes — lets us seed a real catalog at launch instead of an empty database |
| Cleany | Generates the Flutter Clean Architecture folder scaffold so the team starts features consistently without manual boilerplate |
| Swagger / OpenAPI | API documentation served directly from Flask so frontend and backend stay in sync on contract during parallel development |
| Postman | API contract testing — each sprint's endpoints are covered by a Postman collection run before merge to dev |
